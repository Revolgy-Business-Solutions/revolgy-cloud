# Revolgy for developers 
## :cloud:  What we build? 

> From on-premises to running fully managed infrastructure in the Cloud, we know that each use case entails a lot of work and new technologies to process. Our goal is to guide you through the journey of cloud adoption and provide you with know-how as well as industry's best practices tested and developed in years of managing cloud projects. 

We are bunch of ehthusiastic people consisting mainly of cloud engineers and architects. We focus on GCP and AWS cloud platforms. We are constant learners and knowing that cloud is a fast evolving field - we have the rules of learn, relearn and unlearn what we know. Our work is not only development, but also lots of consulting, workshops and trainings.

## :zap: Revolgy culture

### Perks of working in Revolgy

:green_book: We have remote first culture (almost everyone can and is working remotely from different countries).

:notebook: Our work gives us purpose and impacts the society as a whole. (We cooperate with schools and universities).

:orange_book: We build cloud infrastructure that help people in all aspects of life (gaming, fintech for example).

:notebook_with_decorative_cover: We care deeply about the personal growth of people who work with us. (we are working with Gallup talent methodology). 

:ledger: Stress-free culture is the core of our work. Its very important to keep peace of mind. 

:blue_book: We are not afraid to fail. We learn from fails and evolve in our team. 


This is why we'll make sure to give you opportunities to learn new things, grow your career, but also rest when you need to.

### We care about your success
We have an open door policy here. You can speak to anyone, about anything candidly, no matter whether it's a colleague in your team or our CEO Mirek. We're always ready to help each other out and meet everyone's needs to the best of our abilities. We enjoy sharing our professional know-how during internal “lightning talks” or public meet-ups that we organise regularly. We talk about what works and doesn't work for you or the company. We also work with Clifton Strenght's methodology by Gallup to discover our strengths and talents and work with qualified coaches to interpret and develop them further.
 
### We follow our goals
You will work for a mature company with a long history. We celebrated our 25th birthday this year. We know what it takes to get to the top and stay there. Our goal is to help companies work better with the use of cloud technologies, so that they have more time to focus on developing their business. We're backed on this mission by our partners **Google and Amazon**. We were the first cloud services provider on the Czech market, and pioneers in cloud migration of businesses such as the biggest Czech financial institution with thousands of employees and millions of customers. We teach businesses that digitalisation is way more than just scanning documents and manuals.
 
### Career growth
You will get a chance to work with people from the best international corporations and startups. You'll visit famous conferences (Google Cloud Next US, Amazon Re:Invent, Kubecon, etc.) and exchange experiences with professionals in the field of cloud computing.

### Who will your colleagues be
At the moment, there's 50+ of us and we are continuously growing. The average age amongst Revolgians is 32. You won't see a directive leadership or micro-management here. Our team is made of strong individuals who each bring something else to the table. We respect each other on a professional and personal level and this is why we're so effective as a team
 
We value honest, individual approach, willingness to deal with any challenge that we're faced with and eagerness to look for new ways to improve our services. We work in small teams on a variety of projects. We celebrate our achievements and take ownership of our failures as a team.

## :european_castle: Our values
### :coffee: Teamwork
We enjoy working together and we want our customers to enjoy working with us as well.
We believe this value is one of the most important things not only in Revolgy, but also in our everyday life. Working with other people gives us the ability to unlock our mind's hidden potentials as we receive stimulus and information that we might not notice instantly, but it can subconsciously improve us. We are not afraid to take responsibility, not afraid to make important decisions. We are curious, confident, and willing to learn and improve.
 
### Flexibility
Planning is important. But plans often fail. This is why we try to stay agile in our processes as well as our mindset.
Revolgians always know and/or believe that the result of their work has an impact in technological humanity. We are this kind of people who know exactly where we aim, we never leave something to luck.
 
### Innovation
Every day we try to improve and bring a new innovative solution that will simplify the work of our customers.
This is what has brought us to the life we live today. We take it as our mission for the technological humanity to innovate in the field of IT and especially in Cloud.

### Service exceeding expectations
Unless we fully meet our clients' expectations and go the extra mile, we don't consider our work to be done well.
This value is like a multifactor authentication system as it requires multiple steps to be unlocked. We work effectively and quickly, have a futuristic mindset to leave space for growth considering always the maximization of the performance.


### :space_invader: Culture
Our culture can be summed-up in two sentences: 
> “Give it a try first, you can always apologise later. When someone throws down a gauntlet, pick it up and simply start”. 

> No one is parked at the “I-don't-know-how-so-I-wait” station. 

At Revolgy, we face our challenges. If a pipe breaks at your apartment you wouldn't wait for a plumber to turn the water off. You'd simply figure out where the stop valve is. Instructions on how to fix your plumbing are one Google search away, right next to a whole bunch of tutorials on how to link the containers on an app. It isn't a place for people who talk the talk, but don't walk the walk.
