# Revolgy for developers 

## :cloud: What do we build? 

> From on-premises to running fully managed infrastructure in the Cloud, we know that each use case entails a lot of work and new technologies to process. Our goal is to guide you through the journey of cloud adoption and provide you with know-how as well as industry's best practices tested and developed in years of managing cloud projects. 

We are a company of ehthusiastic people consisting mainly of cloud engineers and architects. We focus on the Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services cloud platforms. We are constant learners and knowing that cloud is a fast evolving field - we have the rules of "learn, relearn and unlearn" what we know. Our work is not only development, but also lots of consulting, workshops and trainings.

Our goal is to help companies work more efficiently with the use of cloud technologies so that they have more time to focus on developing their business. We're backed on this mission by our partners **Google** and **Amazon**.

## :european_castle: Our values

### :coffee: Teamwork

We enjoy working together and we want our customers to enjoy working with us as well.
We believe this value is one of the most important things not only in Revolgy, but also in our everyday life. Working with other people gives us the ability to unlock our mind's hidden potential as we receive stimulus and information that we might not notice instantly, but it can subconsciously improve us. We are not afraid to take responsibility and not afraid to make important decisions. We are curious, confident, and willing to learn and improve.
 
### Flexibility

Planning is important. But plans can sometimes fail. This is why we try to stay agile in our processes as well as our mindset.
Revolgians always know and believe that the result of their work has real impact. We are not aimless, and we never leave something to luck.
 
### Innovation

Every day we try to improve and bring a new innovative solution that will simplify the work of our customers.
This is what has brought us to the life we live today. We take it as our mission to be innovative in the field of cloud computing and IT in general.

### Service exceeding expectations

Unless we fully meet and even exceed our clients' expectations, we don't consider our work to be done well.
We work effectively and quickly, we have a futuristic mindset, and we leave some space for growth, with the maximization of our own performance in mind.

### :space_invader: Culture

At Revolgy, we face our challenges. If a pipe breaks in your apartment, you wouldn't wait for a plumber to turn the water off, would you? You'd simply figure out where the valve is. The instructions on how to fix your plumbing are one Google search away.
